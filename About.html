                <h3>My Early Life</h3>
                <p>I grew up in a small town in Iowa not too far from the farm where the Field Of Dreams was filmed. Like many others in the Midwest, it was a quiet, peaceful childhood. My life went along without much excitement through my childhood, teenage years, and into college. One of those friends I made is the reason I ended up in southern Indiana.</p>

            <div class="section-block">
                <h3>Turning Point</h3>
                <p>In my late twenties, I moved here to help that friend open a bar. Long story short, I ended up buying that bar and opening a few others. I had twin boys in 2007, and they became my life. It was just the three of us from the beginning as their mother was not in the picture. So, I worked non-stop to provide a solid and safe future for all of us. But then, a massive stroke threatened to take everything away. I was paralyzed and given little chance to survive, slipping into a vegetative state.</p>

                <h3>Recovery and Redemption</h3>
                <p>An experimental procedure at the University of Louisville saved my life. My rehabilitation tested my strength. I not only learned to walk and talk again but now run races and give motivational speeches. I promised to earn this life and make a difference. But my path was not without its challenges.</p>

                <h3>Changing the Crypto Narrative</h3>
                <p>When Dogecoin burst onto the crypto scene, many projects tried to duplicate its success. Bad actors appeared, with rug pulls and whales extracting wealth from the average investor. I've experienced deceptions by developers and projects that only wanted to pump and dump. This motivated me to bring change.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="section-block">
                <h3>Introducing ALPHAS</h3>
                <p>With some influential players and developers, I've been working on a project that's community-driven and benefits everyone. A team of Alphas has assembled for this cause. These Alphas, involved in other successful projects, wish to remain anonymous. We aim to take the next right step, change the crypto narrative, and realize my vision with ALPHAS.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section-block">
                <h3>The Symbolic Power of ALPHAS</h3>
                <p>As the Alphas and I came to the realization it was time to launch a project for all the people we first had to come up with a symbol that represented my vision of the project we wanted to create. After some brainstorming we came up with the perfect symbol of our community friendly project. Whales are an important part of the crypto ecosystem as they have the power to drive the charts. And depending on their motives at the time of them coming up from the deep they may just as easily drive the price down to suit their plans. And then after making their moves they disappear back to the depths of the crypto ocean until it’s time for their next move. Keeping the investors in the dark as they can’t ever see them coming.</p>
                <p>The Alphas and I wanted our project symbol to represent something as big and as powerful as whales. So, Elephants became our Symbol. As big and as powerful as whales but out in the open and never in hiding. The power to move mountains and never needing the element of surprise to accomplish their goals!</p>
                <p>And in real life these magnificent creatures need our help! They are being hunted for their ivory and being abused in captivity. So, Alphas is donating 1% of sale tax to Elephant charities around the world.</p>
                <p>ALPHAS will make an impact on not only the lives of its community but the community of real-life elephants globally.</p>
